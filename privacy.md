The privacy of your data is of upmost importance to us and we have taken numerous conscious decisions to guarantee that your data is handled carefully and kept as anonymous as possible.

## What Data We Collect

* When you visit the website or the survey within the app, our servers will log your IP address. You IP address is not associated with the survey you complete and is purely used for systems administrative purposes - such as blocking denial of service or malware attempts

* In the website and apps you can optionally provide your location information. We do not collect your exact location, but rather we fuzz this data to your nearest geography - typically a suburb or postcode. We require this geographic information in order to monitor the spread of the virus and to provide crucial health data.
* For the purpose of analytics and improving the survey, we may track the time you take to fill in the survey or how far into the survey you completed for any abandoned surveys.
* We may collect for the purpose of analytics the type of device and browser you are using when visiting the website and completing a survey on either the website or app.

* We will never share your data with any other party unless explicitly stated in this document.

## Deleting Data

## Security & Encryption

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted.
